# Movie App – Database Management System Project

This project is a **database-driven movie catalog application** developed as part of a Database Management Systems (DBMS) course.

The main purpose of the application is to **store, manipulate, search, and rate movies** using a relational database, while providing a simple backend and frontend structure.

---

## 🎯 Project Purpose

The Movie App allows users to:

- Manage a movie catalog (add, update, delete movies)
- Search movies based on different attributes
- Rate movies
- Interact with the database through a Python backend
- Display data using basic HTML pages

The project focuses primarily on **database design and interaction**, rather than advanced UI development.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Database:** MySQL (MySQL Workbench)
- **Backend:** Python
- **Frontend:** HTML
- **DB Access:** SQL queries executed from Python

---

## 🧱 System Architecture

- **MySQL** is used as the database server to store movie-related data.
- **Python** acts as the backend layer, handling:
  - Database connections
  - SQL queries
  - Data manipulation logic
- **HTML files** are used to present data and interact with the user.

The system follows a simple layered structure:

**Frontend (HTML) → Backend (Python) → Database (MySQL)**

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Set up a MySQL server using MySQL Workbench
2. Create the required database and tables
3. Configure database connection settings in the Python backend
4. Run the Python application
5. Open the HTML files in a browser to interact with the system

> Detailed setup instructions may be added later.

## 📌 Notes

- This project is developed for educational purposes but it'll be improved later.
- The primary focus is on **database management and backend logic**.
- The project is still open to improvements and extensions.
